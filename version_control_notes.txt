Version Control and Backups

Why do we care?
- gives us access to open source software projects (GitHub, BitBucket)
-- drupal.org moving to git
- absolutely essential collaboration tool
-- esp. with shared dev servers
- decentralized backups
- REQUIRED for getting a job at any place that's not a joke

What is Version Control?
- keep track of changes made to documents on your computer
- see old versions of your files and restore to them
- share those changes with collaborators
- sync up with your collaborators improvements

How does it work?
- a repo
- a commit
- pull/push
- branching

What are the options?
- Centralized vs. Decentralized
- SVN vs. Hg
- technical: simple vs. more powerful (e.g., cheap branching)

Demo
- bitbucket ssh keys
- staging area: where do commits go?
- hg commit only a certain file/directory.
- branching
